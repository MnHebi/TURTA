# TURTA
The Ultimate Rail Type Addition

The goal of this rail type set is to add rail types that represent the different notable rail gauges, and railway type systems around the world that are able to be implemented in (O)TTD in a way that they are all graphically distinguishable from each other. The set uses the standardized rail type scheme, however utilizing the axle load identifier to represent the gauge due to commonly accepted gauge identifiers being insufficient.


Finished initial proposal, awaiting feedback.
